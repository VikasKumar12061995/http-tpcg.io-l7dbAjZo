<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h2>Chicken</h2><p>Chicken is adelicious meat for me.Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy.</p></div>
<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h3>Beef</h3><p>Beef love beef.Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients. ... Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.</p></div>
<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><h3>Sushi</h3><p>Sushi is also my favourite.Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.</p></div>
